# Technical Challenges

This repo hosts some of my solutions for technical challenges I did.
Most do not include a compreheensive readme, but I will be listing and linking here those that do.

1. [ATM Challenge](/atm_challenge)
App that replicates an ATM.
- No databases allowed
- Withdrawals are sequential
- Withdrawals are always ordered
- There's only one client
- Change has to be the smallest possible
- Withdrawals of the same value in less than 10 minutes are considered duplicate
- Must use Docker

The integration tests and the Readme documents well how it is supposed to work.
